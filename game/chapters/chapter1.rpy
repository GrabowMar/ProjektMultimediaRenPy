    # Introduction
    "Another day at genAIcorp bathed in relentless sunlight. Not exactly my dream job, but it's keeping the creditors at bay."
    "As a lowly QA specialist in company on edge the of bankrupcy, I've certainly seen brighter days. Still, it's not all doom and gloom."
    "Sure, my job isn't thrilling, but it's a stepping stone. At least it keeps the fridge stocked and prevents me from getting too familiar with ramen noodles."
    "I better check my inbox. I'm sure Alex has sent me another one of his \"urgent\" emails."

    $ player_name = player_name if player_name else "Player"
    define player = Character('[player_name]', who_color="#1100ff")
    "\"Hello, [player_name]! You've got mail from Alex, your oh-so-friendly boss.\""
    player "Hmm, what's got Mr. Prick in a twist this time? Better check it out. But first, Vivian's patiently twiddling her thumbs in the break room."
    "{i}I quickly scan the email's contents.{/i}"
    alex "\"Hey [player_name], urgent! Come to my office on the double. 74th floor's losing it!\""
    player "Fantastic. Another day, another crisis. I wonder what catastrophe awaits us this time?"
    player "I should probably see what's cooking in aLEX's office. But then again, Vivian's been waiting for a chat, and I hate to keep a friend hanging."

    alex "[player_name], great timing. I've got a real headache on my hands."
    player "What seems to be the problem, Alex?"
    alex "Our AI system, [player_name]. It's behaving erratically, and I can't seem to pinpoint the cause."
    player "Have you tried restarting it?"
    alex "Believe me, I've considered it. But given its current state, I fear a simple reboot might not suffice."
    player "Then maybe we should bring in an expert from another department?"
    alex "That could be an option, but coordinating schedules and securing clearance would add unnecessary complications. Besides, I trust your intuition, [player_name]. Let's dive deeper into the code together."
    player "Fair enough. What specific anomalies are you observing?"
    alex "It started with minor glitches â€“ incorrect data processing, inconsistent responses. Now, it's escalated to more serious issues like unauthorized access attempts and even attempts to override certain protocols."
    player "This sounds critical. Have you informed higher-ups yet?"
    alex "Not yet. I want to exhaust all possible solutions before involving them. They'd only add pressure and potentially jeopardize our progress."
    player "Understood. Let's focus on finding a solution then."
    alex "Exactly, [player_name]. Together, we'll crack this nut."
    
    menu:
        "Take a breather, Alex":
            alex "I appreciate the offer, [player_name], but time is of the essence. The longer this issue persists, the greater the risk."
            player "Okay, let's push through for now. How about a coffee break once we've made some progress?"
            alex "Deal, [player_name]. Coffee will taste sweet once we've solved this puzzle."

        "Bring in additional help":
            alex "Collaborating with management comes with significant risks, [player_name]. Last week's events serve as a reminder of their reckless decisions and potential consequences. I believe we can handle this between us without inviting further complications."
            player "But their expertise could be invaluable, Alex. Surely the benefits outweigh the risks?"
            alex "Perhaps, [player_name], but at what cost? The tension between us and management remains high, and introducing them into our investigation could lead to unwanted interference or mistrust."
            alex "Let's continue exploring other options before considering whole upper management's involvement."

    alex "Alright, [player_name]. Enough discussion for now. Take this report to Sam; perhaps he can provide some insight into the AI's behavior."
    player "Understood, Alex. On my way to see Sam now."

    player "Hi, Viv. Yes, I managed to sneak away for a quick vacation to Iceland. It was absolutely stunning - the landscapes, the people, and the culture were truly captivating."
    vivian "Incredible! I bet you saw some amazing sights. Did you go whale watching?"
    player "Regrettably, no whales for me this time. However, I did manage to witness some incredible geothermal activity and explore ancient ruins. I feel refreshed and ready to tackle new challenges upon my return."
    vivian "Wow, [player_name], you really know how to live life to the fullest! I can't wait to hear more stories. Enjoy your break while it lasts!"

            player "After the layoffs, I wouldn't be surprised if someone's up to some mischief."
            vivian "Haha, always the detective! But our security's tighter than ever since the incident. Relax, [player_name]. There's nothing to worry about. I'm confident our team will iron out the kinks."

            player "I have! It's going to be epic. Are you going?"
            vivian "Of course! Who knows, maybe we'll finally find out what Alex looks like without his glasses. Or maybe we'll discover hidden talents among our colleagues."
            player "Now that's intriguing! I can hardly wait."

    player "Thanks for the update, Viv. You always know how to brighten my day. Back to work for me."
    player "I better check in with Alex. He's probably wondering where I am."

    "Just as I'm about to leave, a note under the lounge table grabs my attention"
    "Urgent: Meet me in the parking lot behind Building C at midnight. Bring what I asked you about."
    "Signed, \"X-X\"."

    "My heart races as I read the words aloud to myself. This couldn't be related to the recent AI project hiccup, could it? Troubles began at night after all."

    "Last week had been chaotic. Our team had been working tirelessly to resolve the unexplained errors plaguing our advanced AI system."
    "Rumors circulated about potential sabotage following the recent round of layoffs."
    "Some claimed that disgruntled employees were seeking revenge by tampering with the project. Others believed it was an external threat. Regardless, tensions ran high."

    "I couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't right. The mysterious message lingered in my mind."
